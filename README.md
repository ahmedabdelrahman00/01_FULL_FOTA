# Full FOTA (Flash Over The Air) for STM32

This project offers a comprehensive Full FOTA (Flash Over The Air) implementation tailored for STM32 microcontrollers, utilizing a dual bank system for secure and reliable firmware updates over Wi-Fi. It features integration with ESP8266/ESP32 for Wi-Fi connectivity and optionally leverages Firebase for update notifications and delivery.

## Features

- **Dual Bank System**: Implements a dual bank approach to enable safe firmware updates, with seamless fallback on update failures.
- **Wi-Fi Connectivity via ESP**: Uses ESP8266/ESP32 modules for connecting to Wi-Fi and downloading firmware updates.
- **Update Notifications**: Optionally integrates with Firebase for sending update notifications to the STM32 device.
- **STM32CubeIDE & VS Code Support**: Project setup and development support for STM32CubeIDE and Visual Studio Code.

## Requirements

- **STM32CubeIDE**: For project development and firmware flashing.
- **Visual Studio Code**: Optional, for those who prefer VS Code for development with appropriate extensions.
- **ST-Link Utility**: For programming and debugging STM32 devices via the ST-Link.
- **Firebase (Optional)**: If using Firebase for update notifications or deployment, a Firebase account and project setup are necessary.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

1. Install STM32CubeIDE from the [STMicroelectronics website](https://www.st.com/en/development-tools/stm32cubeide.html).
2. Install Visual Studio Code from the [official website](https://code.visualstudio.com/) if preferred. Ensure relevant extensions (e.g., C/C++, Cortex-Debug) are installed.
3. Download and install the ST-Link Utility for your operating system from [STMicroelectronics](https://www.st.com/en/development-tools/stsw-link004.html).

### Project Setup

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>

   
1. **Open the Project:**
In STM32CubeIDE: File > Open Projects from File System... and select the project directory.
In VS Code: Open the project folder directly.
Firmware Flashing
Connect your STM32 device via ST-Link to your computer.
Open the project in STM32CubeIDE.
Build the project: Project > Build Project.
Flash the firmware: Run > Debug.
Usage
Once flashed, the STM32 device will use the ESP module to connect to Wi-Fi.
The device periodically checks for updates, which can be hosted on a server or through Firebase, depending on your setup.
Upon finding an update, the device downloads and applies it using the dual bank system.
